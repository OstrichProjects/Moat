Submission for Moat Pre-Interview Test
====

There are two different incr_dict functions, recursive and iterative.  To call these functions in an instance of python, import MoatIter and MoatRecur and run either MoatIter.incr_dict(dict,tuple) or MoatRecur.incr_dict(dict,tuple).

Testing
====

To test, install pytest with "pip install pytest" and run py.test while in the Moat parent directory.

Conclusions
====

The recursive function is simpler, but does not work for long input tuples.  The iterative function works for long input tuples, but is a little more complicated.
